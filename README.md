My majorly contributed in the coding part, I mainly focused on writing cirrect scripts to run the game smoothly.
For the art part I used the sample arts provided, I also added some animations to different actions of player and the enemy.

Overview of the game :-
the game is straightforward and simple, we have 5 levels in the game and the goal of each level is to defeat the enemy and go to next level, the difficulty increases level after as it requires more hits to kill the enemy as the level increases(specifically the number of hits required to kill the enemy is equal to the level number).
the player can move, jump and attack the enemy, the enemy can move and chase the player and can attack the player.
Controls of the game :-
Left and right arrow keys are for left and right movement of the player respectively, up(^)arrow key is for making the player jump, by pressing the Spacebar the player will attack the enemy.
